# The Steps in Performing the Assignment Script


## Introduction
In Module 7, we learned about working with Text Files, Binary Files, Error Handling, and Creating Advanced GitHub pages with Markdown. 
Module 7 assignment is creating a script using Exception Handling and Pickling.
I’d like to explain the steps I took in performing this assignment.  
  
  
  
## What are steps?
### 1.	Start with simple script using Lab7-1
I have to include Pickling and Exception Handling, but first, I started with a simple Lab7-1 file to use Pickling.

It is working fine!

### 2. Think about possible errors and modify the script (ID Number)  
Now I have to add Error Handling. What kind of errors can be created by user? One possibility is user input incorrect ID number, for example, not number. (int)  

First, I just input “one” for the ID number, and this is Python’s error message

I added try and except as below into my script. If the user inputs numeric ID number, the entire script will be executed, otherwise print the error message to the user.

### 3. Think of another possible error and modify the script (Name)



## Summary
 
   Here is the summary of steps to complete this assignment.  
        1. Start with simple script using Lab7-1  
        2. Think about possible errors and modify the script (ID Number)  
        3. Think of another possible error and modify the script (Name)
